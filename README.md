# Portfolio_Website

## Site Purpose

This is a portfolio website for my internet and web systems class! It mainly acts
as a resume/a way to show off my projects to people who would want to see them. I
will try my best to update this website as my projects change or as I add new projects
to my github account. I will also update the main page whenever I gain more skills
or get more professional work experience. 

## Structure

The structure of my portfolio website is a main page, a projects pages, and a contact page.
The main page has a "hero card" with a short description of myself, a selfie, and some
links to other pages/my socials. The bottom of the page is meant to be kind of like a resume.
There are descriptions of my education, my skills, and professional experience. There is also
a WOW feature that I had to implement for my web systems class which is a spinner wheel that
give you a fun fact about me. This is actually a pie chart that I have rotating like a spinner 
wheel/wheel of fortune game. The projects page contains "cards" that show off projects I've worked
on they also act as links to the github repos that hold them. The contact page just has my linkedin
and school email.

## How to update it

When making a change to this website please make all changes on a separate branch and merge it 
once you are good with the look of it. Also please make sure there are no issues when resizing.
